Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) Algorithm


- Take human input: Buttons or Text
	> 3 buttons
	> Store chosen value in a variable


- Make machine input RPS random
	> Math random function from 1 to 3, one number RPS option
	> Store output in variable


- Make evaluation logic for RPS
	> Make if-else function for win and ties


- Best of 5 counter
	> Variable for human
	> Variable for computer
	> Add 1 to winning variable depending on evaluation result

- New round function
	> Reset function to reset machine and human input after evaluation and counter 


- Declare winner
	> Function that declares first to reach 5 the winner 
	> Pop-up for new game option


- New game function
	> Reset counter
